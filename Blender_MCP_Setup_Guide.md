# Blender MCP Setup: Final Step

**Everything is installed and configured except for one thing inside Blender.**

## Remaining Action: Install the Blender Add-on

1. Open **Blender 5.0**.
2. In the top menu, go to **Edit** > **Preferences**.
3. Select **Add-ons** from the left sidebar.
4. Click the **Install...** button (top right).
5. Navigate to this file and select it:
    `C:\Users\heroy\antigravity\mcp-servers\blender-mcp\addon.py`
    *(Copy-paste this path into the file address bar in Blender to find it quickly)*
6. Once installed, check the box next to **"Interface: Blender MCP"** to enable it.
    *(If you don't see it, search for "MCP" in the add-ons search bar)*

## Verification

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (Quit fully and open again).
2. The `blender` tool should now be active.
